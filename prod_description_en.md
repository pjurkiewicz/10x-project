### Main Problem
Manually creating high-quality educational flashcards is time-consuming, which discourages people from using effective learning methods like spaced repetition.

### Minimum Feature Set
- AI-generated flashcards from user-provided text (copy-paste)
- Manual flashcard creation
- Review, edit, and delete flashcards
- Simple user account system to store flashcards
- Integration with ready-made spaced repetition algorithm

### What's NOT in MVP Scope
- Custom, advanced spaced repetition algorithm (like SuperMemo, Anki)
- Import of multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- Sharing flashcard sets between users
- Integrations with other educational platforms
- Mobile apps (web-only initially)

### Success Criteria
- 75% of AI-generated flashcards are accepted by users
- Users create 75% of flashcards using AI
